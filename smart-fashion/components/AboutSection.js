          <p>We are Mr. Max and Mr. Raj in the beautiful city of Chiang Mai, Thailand. Whether you are on a vacation and came across our shop, or just looking for custom clothing that makes you look and feel great, you came to the right place. Lucky for you, we can ship to you if you aren't in the area!</p>
          <p>We have been joyfully serving customers for 5 years, selling thousands of suits, tuxes, shirts, and dresses. Anything you can dream up, we can make. Why spend thousands for a suit when you can get the same thing from us for only a few hundred? Not only are our prices good, we know how to help you look stunning for any occasion. It's important to look and feel your best. We priortize that.</p>
